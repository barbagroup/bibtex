# bibtex files

Group BibTeX databases of references.

####Usage:

Use the environment variable BIBINPUTS to set the path to your local-machine where you cloned this repo. This way, the \bibliography command works for all group members (as no hard path is provided to the database files).

Sometimes, processing an article with LaTeX generates an additional .bib file in your working directory for footnotes that are added to the list of references (this happens with the RevTeX format). You then have to remember to copy this file over to your BIBINPUTS location (with the other BibTeX files), or your \bibliography won't find it, and you will get an error "I couldn't open database file <article name>.bib ... I'm skipping whatever remains of this command" followed by "I found no database files" and a failure to create the bibliography. SIGH. This can stump you and make you waste a couple of hours before you realize it.

**Always copy any footnote file generated by LaTeX `article name.bib` into your BIBINPUTS location.**
