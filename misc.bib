	Abstract = {The article analyzes the feasibility of using a tablet personal computer (PC) and related technologies in mathematics teaching in Australia. Teachers in universities have been using the tablet PC to augment the quality of their lectures in various subjects including chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Trials were conducted at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in 2006 to explore the efficiency of electronic writing in mathematics classes. Results of the trials revealed the preference of students for the use of the tablet PC in lectures.},
